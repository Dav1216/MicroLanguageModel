# MicroLanguageModel
This is a rough first exploration experiment with language models, using a feedforward neural network, more specifically a WaveNet variant to produce text based on the Iliad by Homer which I attached [here](ily.txt). <br>
The code is [here](WaveNetNext.ipynb). In the future I will try to beat the performance of this using a transformer neural network.
