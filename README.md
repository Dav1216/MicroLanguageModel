# MicroLanguageModel
This uses a feedforward neural network, more specifically a WaveNet variant to produce text based on the Iliad by Homer which I attached in [ily.txt](ily.txt). <br>
This servers the purpose of a first experiment with language models. In the future I will try to beat the performance of this using a transformer neural network.
